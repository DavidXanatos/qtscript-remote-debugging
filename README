Classes and tools for remote QtScript debugging

This project needs to be compiled against the qt/master sources:
http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt

The classes need some symbols that are not exported by default from the
QtScriptTools module in Qt. In order to export the necessary symbols, define
QT_BUILD_INTERNAL before building QtScriptTools, for example by adding the
following line to $QTDIR/src/scripttools/scripttools.pro:

DEFINES += QT_BUILD_INTERNAL

After QtScriptTools is built in this fashion, you should be able to run
qmake && make in this project's top-level folder and everything should
build and link. If you get a compile error saying that it can't find
private/* headers, you're not compiling against the Qt _sources_ (you can't
compile against an _installed_ Qt because private headers are not installed).

An example debuggable application is provided in examples/debuggee.
An example debugger is provided in examples/debugger.
To try them, first start examples/debuggee, then start examples/debugger.
